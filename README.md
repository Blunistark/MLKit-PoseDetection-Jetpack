# MLKit-PoseDetection-Jetpack
This android project is based on pose detection using ML Kit and jetpack compose. CameraX is used for capture video frame. Official google [ML Kit](https://developers.google.com/ml-kit/vision/pose-detection/android) has used activity for the pose detection. But in this project jetpack-compose is used for pose detection.

I have tried to simplify the source code so that anyone can integrate this pose estimation in their project.
